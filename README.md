This project is an attempt to reproduce the experiment described [here](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~viscomp/projects/SIG17HDR/) [1]. It consist in merging three LDR images of different exposition of the same scene into one HDR image. To do so, an [optical flow algorithm](https://github.com/pathak22/pyflow) is used to align the three images. Then, a CNN with 4 layers is used to model the merging process. You can download the low quality images report [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=16XIUggY6cVzixEaxSHQnnkfO5L615Pqt) or download the high quality images [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fB23DP5YizyGd1-aIqYVfuQmMSM2C4Oy/view?usp=sharing). The resulting HDR images of 15 scenes generated by our CNN and the results of the original paper can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1maYrWqpY-AazD4jqdEkdP_LH5uFrIypz) (HDRImg is the result of the original paper).

Scene folder need to follow this structure:

---scene        
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|---test     
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|---training

The path to the root scene folder can be changed in the file Constants.py
